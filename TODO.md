# TODO

* Shell script to copy all example project files to where they would normally reside.
* Role specific ```settings.yml``` file to minimise the need for 'project' files.
* ```README.md``` files for all 'common' & 'project' directories to keep said directories in version control even if empty. Will need to update .gitignore to suit.
